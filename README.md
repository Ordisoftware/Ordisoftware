â€¢ **Telecommute Analyst-programmer: Agile creation of object-oriented applications<br>**
â€¢ **C# Desktop Expert: Visual Studio, WinForms, Linq, ADO.NET, GitHub, WordPress**

I was brought up with Basic, Assembly, C and C++ languages. After working with Delphi for companies, I specialized in C#. My main aptitude is the object code and the conceptualization of the data and its processing. Programming is a passion both as a job and as a leisure that one never tire of as there are so many things to discover, to learn and to achieve.

I was born in 1973. I'm partially deaf and hard of hearing since 1984. I am thus became neuroatypical. I study the physical and biological sciences since 1992 as well as the Hebrew Torah since January 2004. I am physically disabled since April 2004. I write software and books since 2011 about what I'm learning.
