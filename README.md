â€¢ **Teleworking Analyst-programmer: Agile creation of object-oriented applications<br>**
â€¢ **C# Desktop Expert: Visual Studio, WinForms, Linq, ADO.NET, GitHub, WordPress**

I was brought up with Basic, Assembly, C and C++ languages. After working with Delphi for companies, I specialized in C#. My main aptitude is the object code, and the conceptualization of the data and its processing. Programming is a passion both as a job and as a leisure that one never tire of as there are so many things to discover, to learn and to achieve.

I have been physically disabled since April 2004.

I was born in 1973 and I study the Hebrew Torah since January 2004, thus I write software and books since 2011 about what I learn.
