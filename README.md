I was brought up with Basic, Assembly, C and C++ languages. After working with Delphi for companies, I specialized in C#. My main aptitude is the object code and the conceptualization of the data and its processing. Programming is a passion both as a job and as a leisure that one never tire of as there are so many things to discover, to learn and to achieve.
