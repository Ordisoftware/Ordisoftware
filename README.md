## Who am I?

• **Telecommute Analyst-programmer: Agile creation of object-oriented applications**\
• **C# Desktop Expert: Visual Studio, WinForms, Linq, ADO.NET, GitHub, WordPress**\

I was brought up with Basic, Assembly, C and C++ languages. After working with Delphi for companies, I specialized in C#. Programming is a passion both as a job and as a leisure that one never tire of as there are so many things to discover, to learn and to achieve. My main aptitude is the object code and the conceptualization of the data and its processing.
