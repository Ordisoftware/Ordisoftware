## Who am I?

• **Telecommute Analyst-Programmer: Agile creation of object-oriented applications**<br>
• **C# Desktop Expert: Visual Studio, WinForms, Linq, ADO.NET, GitHub, WordPress**

I was brought up on  Basic, Assembly, C and C++ since 1984. After working with Delphi for financial and medical companies from 1998 to 2003, I specialized in C#. My main aptitude is the object code and the conceptualization of the data and its processing. Coding is a passion both as a job and as a leisure that one never tire of as there are so many things to discover, learn, design and create.
